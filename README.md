## üöÄ Installation

You can install the package using npm or yarn:

```bash
npm install @aleksei-uzin/custom-components-lib
```

## Usage

Here's a basic example of how to use a component from the library.

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import { Button } from '@aleksei-uzin/custom-components-lib'

function MyApp() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome to my app</h1>
      <Button onClick={() => alert('Button clicked!')}>Click Me</Button>
    </div>
  )
}

export default MyApp
```

## üìñ Storybook

This library uses [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) for component development and documentation. To run Storybook locally, use the following command:

```bash
npm run storybook
```

This will start the Storybook development server, and you can view the components at `http://localhost:6006`.

In the project directory, you can run:

- `npm run build`: Builds the library for production.
- `npm run release`: Builds and publishes the library to npm.
- `npm run storybook`: Starts the Storybook development server.
- `npm run build-storybook`: Builds Storybook as a static web application.
- `npm run lint`: Lints the source files using ESLint.
- `npm run format:check`: Checks for formatting issues with Prettier.
- `npm run format:write`: Formats the source files with Prettier.
